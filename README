An example of system level testing
==================================

While very simplistic, this provides a basic example of a system-level
integration test using RSpec, Capybara and Poltergeist.

The system is specified in the Procfile. It consists of two apps, `auth` and
`toots`, as well as an Nginx web server. The test, `features/tooting_spec.rb`,
starts Foreman in a separate process, runs Capybara against the Nginx
instance, and shuts down Foreman afterwards.

The test itself is pretty stupid, and could use some abstractions, but this is
the basic idea.

The technique of course becomes more interesting as soon as other services
such as Solr and Redis come into the mix. I imagine one could even boot a
simple mail server and client and do complete integration testing a e-mail
scenarios such as:

    When I register as a user
    Then I should receive a confirmation e-mail

    When I click the link in the confirmation e-mail
    Then my user account should be confirmed
